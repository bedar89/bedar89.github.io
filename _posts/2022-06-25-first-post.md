# Hello World

This is my first post and thus testing some stuff out :)

```yaml
name: 'push-remote'

on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main
        paths-ignore:
            - .gitignore
            - README.md
            - LICENSE
```

```
This is without specifying a programming language
```

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt-upgrade -y
```
## Todo list test
Does this work with a todo-list?
