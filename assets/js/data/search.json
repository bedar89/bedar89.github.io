It can be use for a documentation site, a blog, an event site, or really any web site you like. It‚Äôs fast, secure, easy, and open source. It‚Äôs also the same site generator I use to maintain my open source documentation. Today, we‚Äôll be installing and configuring Jekyll using the Chirpy theme. We configure the site, create some pages with markdown, automatically build it with a GitHub action and even host it for FREE on GitHub pages. If you don‚Äôt want to host in the cloud, show how to host it on your own server or even in Docker.Install Depende#nciessudo apt updatesudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev gitTo avoid installing RubyGems packages as the root user:If you are using bash (usually the default for most)echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrcecho 'export GEM_HOME=\"$HOME/gems\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrcecho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrcsource ~/.bashrcIf you are using zsh (you know if you are)echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrcecho 'export GEM_HOME=\"$HOME/gems\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrcecho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrcsource ~/.zshrcInstall Jekyll bundlergem install jekyll bundlerCreating a site based on Chirpy StarterVisit https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#quick-startAfter creating a site based on the template, clone your repogit clone git@&lt;YOUR-USER-NAME&gt;/&lt;YOUR-REPO-NAME&gt;.gitthen install your dependenciescd repo-namebundleAfter making changes to your site, commit and push then up to gitgit add .git commit -m \"made some changes\"git pushJekyll Commandsserving your sitebundle exec jekyll sBuilding your site in production modeJEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll bThis will output the production site to _siteBuilding Site in CIThis site already works with GitHub actions, just push it up and check the actions Tab.,For GitLab you can see the pipeline I built for my own docs site hereBuilding with DockerCreate a Dockerfile with the followingFROM nginx:stable-alpineCOPY _site /usr/share/nginx/htmlBuild site in production modeJEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll bThen build your image:docker build .Creating a PostNaming ConventionsJekyll uses a naming convention for pages and postsCreate a file in _posts with the formatYEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.mdFor example:2022-05-23-homelab-docs.md2022-05-34-hardware-specs.mdJekyll can delay posts which have the date/time set for a point in the future determined by the ‚Äúfront matter‚Äù section at the top of your post file.
